        <h2>What is Affordable Housing?</h2>
          <p>As defined by affordablehousingonline.com, affordable housing is "housing that doesn't cost more than 30% of your family income".</p>

          <p>But it doesn't just end with this. What it really all boils down to is the idea that there aren't enough housing units for people who need them. This basic human resource that should be a standard for everyone isn't available.</p>

        <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>As of March 1, 2019 over 5 million low-income households in the United States are looking to rent modest housing at an affordable cost.</li>
            <li>For every 100 extremely low income households, there are only 29 adequate, affordable, and available rental units.</li>
            <li>That means two parents who both work minimum-wage jobs might wait years to find a safe, affordable place to live with their two kids.</li>
            <li>Essentially, the demand for affordable housing is too high to keep up with the people who need this basic human right.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>What Next</h2>
          <p>This website has offered just a glimpse into how affordable housing needs to be changed. New laws need to be inacted. Incentives such as housing vouchers, rent control and mixed-income households need to be readily available. Lastly, there has to be a willingness from contractors and law makers to build more affordable houses for residents that need them in a vast amount of neighborhoods in order to combat the lack of upward mobility.</p>

          <p>If this topic interest you and you would like to find out more information, I have included three links that will give a further explanation of affordable housing as well as a breakdown on how the nuances with affordable housing can be rectified.</p>
